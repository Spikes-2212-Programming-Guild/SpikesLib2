## Adaptive Pure Pursuit Controller

This code is our implementation of an Adaptive Pure Pursuit Controller according to the specification of team [Dawgma 1712](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/t/paper-implementation-of-the-adaptive-pure-pursuit-controller/166552).

Currently, we support only Tank drivetrains, and will be glad to accept contributions. 

Command bindings for this controller are located in `com.spikes2212.command.drivetrains.command`
